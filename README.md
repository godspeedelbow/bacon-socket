# Streaming Sockets with Bacon.js

Playing with [Bacon.js](http://baconjs.github.io/) and websockets to try out Functional Reactive Programming.

As I had to stream *something*, I used the meetup.com RSVP stream. So this is what you get when you run it:

## Install

- node >= 7 required because of `async/await`

- `npm i` to install deps

- `npm start` to start the streaming
